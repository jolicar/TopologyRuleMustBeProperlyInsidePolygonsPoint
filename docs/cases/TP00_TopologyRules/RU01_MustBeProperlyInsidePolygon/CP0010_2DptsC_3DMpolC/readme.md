### Description

This test case checks the topology rule when us use a correct 2D point dataset and 3DM polygon dataset. The final result of this is correct too.

### Requirements

1. Have *gvSIG desktop 2.5.1* and *Topology framework plugin* installed.
2. Have acces to [**TP00RU01CP0010_pol3DM_C.csv**](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleMustBeProperlyInsidePolygonsPoint/blob/master/testing/cases/TP00_TopologyRules/RU01_MustBeProperlyInsidePolygon/CP0010_2DptsC_3DMpolC/TP00RU01CP0010_pol3DM_C.csv) and [**TP00RU01CP0010_pts2D_C.csv**](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleMustBeProperlyInsidePolygonsPoint/blob/master/testing/cases/TP00_TopologyRules/RU01_MustBeProperlyInsidePolygon/CP0010_2DptsC_3DMpolC/TP00RU01CP0010_pts2D_C.csv) files.

### Steps...

1. Load the layer **TP00RU01CP0010_pol3DM_C.csv** in the view.
2. Load the layer **TP00RU01CP0010_pts02D_C.csv** in the view.
3. Create a new empty topology plan.
4. Fill the basic topology plan data.
5. Add the **TP00RU01CP0010_pol3DM_C.csv** file like a dataset.
6. Add the **TP00RU01CP0010_pts2D_C.csv** file like a dataset.
7. Add a new rules parameters on Rules tab.
8. On those rule parameters identify the *primary dataset*, the *second dataset*, the *Must Be Properly Inside topology rule* and the *tolerancy*. 
9. Click on the "Ok" button.
10. Click on the "Ok" button to finish the topology plan creation.
11. Execute the topology plan.

### Expected result

The expected results are the *Inspector de errores del Plan de topología* window empty. This interface has no records.


### Bug report
