If the tolerance is greater than zero, the point are transformed into 'polygon'. If one point of this new polygon are inside of dataset 2 polygon, the rule return True. \n \n NOTE 2: For multipoints, if all of their geometries are within the polygon or multipoligon, the rule returns True. For Multipolygon, if one of these geometries has at least one point or multipoint inside, the rule returns True."
