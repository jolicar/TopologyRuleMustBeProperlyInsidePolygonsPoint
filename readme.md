![TopologyRuleMustBeProperlyInsidePolygonsPoint](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleMustBeProperlyInsidePolygonsPoint/blob/master/img/TP00R01_img1.png)
* **Rule type:** *Point rule*
* **Primary dataset:** Point dataset (2D, 2DM, 3D and 3DM)
* **Secundary dataset:** Polygon dataset (2D, 2DM, 3D and 3DM)
* **Multygeometry allowed:** :white_check_mark:
* **Brief description:** In this rule the points must fall within the polygon's area, not on the boundary or out of it. The red points does the rule false and the green points give a positive result on the rule.
