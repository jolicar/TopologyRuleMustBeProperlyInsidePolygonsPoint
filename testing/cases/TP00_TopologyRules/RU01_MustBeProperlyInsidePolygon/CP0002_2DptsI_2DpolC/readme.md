## TP00RU01CP0002 Test that all 2D points are inside 2D polygons.

[First, check the open issues of this test](https://redmine.gvsig.net/redmine/projects/gvsig-desktop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=status_id&op%5Bstatus_id%5D=o&f%5B%5D=subject&op%5Bsubject%5D=%7E&v%5Bsubject%5D%5B%5D=TP00RU01CP0002&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=tracker&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=updated_on&group_by=)

### Description

This test case checks the topology rule when us use incorrect 2D point datasets and correct 2D polygon dataset. The difference between this and CP0000 is that the polygon dataset presents a polygon with no point. The final result has no errors.

### Requirements

1. Have *gvSIG desktop 2.5.1* and *Topology framework plugin* installed.
2. Have acces to [**TP00RU01CP0002_pol2D_C.csv**](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleMustBeProperlyInsidePolygonsPoint/blob/master/testing/cases/TP00_TopologyRules/RU01_MustBeProperlyInsidePolygon/CP0002_2DptsI_2DpolC/TP00RU01CP0002_pol2D_C.csv) and [**TP00RU01CP0002_pts2D_I.csv**](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleMustBeProperlyInsidePolygonsPoint/blob/master/testing/cases/TP00_TopologyRules/RU01_MustBeProperlyInsidePolygon/CP0002_2DptsI_2DpolC/TP00RU01CP0002_pts2D_I.csv) files.

### Steps...

1. Load the layer **TP00RU01CP0002_pol2D_C.csv** in the view.
2. Load the layer **TP00RU01CP0002_pts2D_I.csv** in the view.
3. Create a new empty topology plan.
4. Fill the basic topology plan data.
5. Add the **TP00RU01CP0002_pol2D_C.csv** file like a dataset.
6. Add the **TP00RU01CP0002_pts2D_I.csv** file like a dataset.
7. Add a new rules parameters on Rules tab.
8. On those rule parameters identify the *primary dataset*, the *second dataset*, the *Must Be Properly Inside topology rule* and the *tolerancy*. 
9. Click on the "Ok" button.
10. Click on the "Ok" button to finish the topology plan creation.
11. Execute the topology plan.

### Expected result

The expected results are the *Inspector de errores del Plan de topología* window empty. This interface has no records.
